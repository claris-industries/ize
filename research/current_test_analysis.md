# Current PassthroughFS Test Analysis

## Overview

After removing the verbose mount tests, we now have focused tests that demonstrate the operations we need to intercept for versioning, without the complexity of actual FUSE mounting.

## Current Test Files

### 1. `tests/operation_capture.rs` (Standalone Integration Test)

**Purpose**: Documents and validates the operations that need to be tracked for versioning.

**Tests**:
- `test_operation_recording_concept` - Demonstrates how we'll record operations with a simple `OperationRecorder` mock
- `test_passthrough_basic_setup` - Verifies PassthroughFS can be instantiated without mounting
- `test_operations_to_track` - Documents the 10 key operations we need to version
- `test_operation_data_requirements` - Specifies what data each operation needs to capture

### 2. `tests/functional/operation_capture_test.rs` (Module Test)

Same tests as above but integrated into the test harness framework.

## Operations Identified for Tracking

From the tests, we've identified these operations that need versioning:

1. **create** - New file creation
   - Required: path, mode, flags, initial_content

2. **write** - File content modification  
   - Required: path, offset, data, size

3. **unlink** - File deletion
   - Required: path, parent_inode

4. **rename** - File/directory move or rename
   - Required: old_path, new_path, old_parent, new_parent

5. **mkdir** - Directory creation
   - Required: path, mode, parent_inode

6. **rmdir** - Directory removal
   - Required: path, parent_inode

7. **setattr** - Metadata changes
   - Required: path, mode, uid, gid, size, atime, mtime

8. **truncate** - File size changes
   - Not yet detailed in tests

9. **symlink** - Symbolic link creation
   - Not yet detailed in tests

10. **link** - Hard link creation
    - Not yet detailed in tests

## Key Insights from Current Tests

### What's Working
- Clean separation of concerns - tests focus on *what* to track, not *how*
- No FUSE mounting complexity - tests run fast and reliably
- Clear documentation of requirements via test assertions
- `OperationRecorder` provides a good model for the actual storage interface

### What's Missing
- No actual integration with PassthroughFS operations yet
- No tests for concurrent operations
- No tests for error scenarios (storage failures, etc.)
- No performance benchmarks

### What Was Removed (and Why)
The old mount tests (`passthrough_test.rs`, `mount_test.rs`) were removed because they:
- Required actual FUSE mounting (slow, flaky in CI)
- Had lots of boilerplate for mount/unmount lifecycle
- Mixed concerns (testing FUSE mounting vs testing version tracking)
- Were verbose without adding clarity

## Next Steps for Testing

1. **Integration Point Tests**: Create tests that show where in PassthroughFS we'll inject the storage calls
2. **Mock Storage Tests**: Test the storage trait with an in-memory implementation
3. **Concurrent Operation Tests**: Verify thread-safety of operation recording
4. **Performance Baseline**: Establish benchmarks before adding versioning overhead

## Design Validation

The current tests validate our design approach:
- Operations are clearly defined with specific data requirements
- The `OperationRecorder` pattern shows how we'll integrate storage
- No coupling to specific storage backends (trait-based approach)
- Focus on filesystem operations, not storage implementation details

This minimal test suite gives us a solid foundation to build on without the maintenance burden of the previous verbose tests.
